Again I feel most of the explanation is within the code itself, but in this assignment we had '5' questions,

Question 1 is regarding good coding practices.

Question 2 was implementing the gradient descent algorithm. In short, this is a minimization problem to find the
minimum of a smooth function, iteratively, and plotting releveant graphs

Question 3 is regarding linear regression in 3 dimensions. The actual process of gaathering the data I found manageable, however
I could not seem to wrap my head around how to do the surface plot of the regression plane itself.

Question 4 was concerned with logistic regression, where the code was already written out and we were to add comments
throughout to explain what was happening. I found this difficult as well but felt I was able to understand it after a while! 

Question 5 was about image binary classification, which I found very intersting but could not get myself to understand 
in an intuitive way. I'm hoping I will be able to grasp this topic eventually, as I've always wondered how computers/machines
were able to understand data like images and make some statement about the content of them. 

This was the hardest project so far for me and I wan't to apologize for the messiness! Hopefully I will be back on track 
for the next one.
